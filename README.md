ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vincent 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in developing Webpages using HTML-CSS, JS, ASP and SQL

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also currently learning XAML, SQL, C# and ASP.NET for my college program... As for my freelancing I am more into learning Javascript since I have plans to work on web development before moving on to complex works

âš¡ Fun fact: There is none at the moment 
  
ðŸ“« How to reach me...?
(These are my active social media accounts and where to easily find me.)
