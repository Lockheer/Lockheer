ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vincent //but you can call me "Kyoto"

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in developing Webpages using HTML-CSS, JS, ASP and SQL

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also currently learning XAML, SQL, C# and ASP.NET for my college program... As for my freelancing I am more into learning Javascript since I have plans to work on web development before moving on to complex works

âš¡ Fun fact: I fell in love with appalachian wine
  
ðŸ“« How to reach me...?
