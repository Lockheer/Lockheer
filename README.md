Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Raul Vincent 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing Database Systems and Schemas with SQL and Webpages using HTML-CSS, JS, and ASP...

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also currently learning XAML, SQL, C# and ASP.NET for my college program... As for my freelancing I am more into learning Javascript since I have plans to work on web development before moving on to complex works

âš¡ Fun fact: I rarely eat sweets....
  
ðŸ“« How to reach me...?
(These are my active social media accounts and where to easily find me.)
